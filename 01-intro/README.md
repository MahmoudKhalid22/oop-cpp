## Access modifier

* An access modifier is a cpp keyword that indicates how a field or method can be accessed.

* public
    When the public access modifier is applied to a class member, the member can be accessed by code inside the calss or outside.

* private
    When the private access modifier is applied to a class member, the member can't be accessed by code outside the calss. The member can be accessed only by methods that are members of the same class.

## Data Hiding

* it is important because classes are typically used as components in large software systems, involving a team of programmers

* it helps enforce the integrity of an object's internal data
